EV3 Code Library
================

**EV3 Code Library** is a library which uses ev3dev(a package that allows coding ev3 robots with
python). EV3 Code Library adds other functions like line followers and gyro driving programs in
order to expand the functionality of an EV3. This library is ideal for helping with coding an EV3
for something like FIRST LEGO League Challenge.
